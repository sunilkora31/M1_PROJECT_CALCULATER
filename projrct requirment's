The calculator has the following keys: 0..9, ., +, -, *, /, ±, =, C, CE and 1-operand keys: 1/x, x2
sqrt. 
In any situation the calculator has to produce a correct result defined by the well known
arithmetic rules.
 If the calculations is impossible the calculator has to display information helping
the user to resolve the erroneous situation,
 like:
On encountering a division by 0 the display should read "Cannot divide by 0" and typing the
key “C” should reset the calculator.
 On calculating the square root value of a negative operand the display should read "Wrong
operand".
On erroneous operand or operation keys the display should read “Reset (C) to continue” or
“Clear (CE) to continue” as appropriate.
Of course, any situation can be cleared using the main reset key “C”.
