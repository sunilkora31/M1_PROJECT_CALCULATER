The calculator design system:

Before we start to think about a calculator state machine we should make a design of the
calculator control system. 
Parse the incoming keys and assign them to the appropriate control value.
• Complete an Expression string from incoming keys.
• Perform a calculation defined by the Expression string according to arithmetic rules, when
1/12
encountering operator keys +, -, *, / as well as the Equals key =. We notice that we need
several calculation functions as the the rule for a calculation after Equals key and addition
and subtraction operators are different than for multiplication and division operators.
